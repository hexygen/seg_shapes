# Segmented Shapes Dataset

This database was used in the paper "SHED: Shape Edit Distance for Fine-grained Shape Similarity".

These datasets are based on the [COSEG dataset](http://irc.cs.sdu.edu.cn/~yunhai/public_html/ssl/ssd.htm).
We enriched some of the datasets to generate more variations within each set.
Each collection includes the models in *.off* format, a segmentation of each shape generated using [Approximate Convexity Analysis](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~noafish/wcseg/), and a thumbnail image for each shape.

There are four categories:
- Vases (80 shapes)
- Lamps (100 shapes)
- Candles (42 shapes)
- Planes (70 shapes)
